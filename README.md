# Problem  1
The "findMinFromArr" method recursively finds the minimum value in an integer array by repeatedly dividing the array into smaller sub-arrays and comparing their minimum values until the minimum value of the entire array is found.
# Problem 2
The "findSum" method recursively finds the sum of all the elements in an integer array by adding the last element of the array to the sum of the rest of the elements obtained through recursive calls. The "findAverage" method uses the "findSum" method to find the sum of all the elements in the array and then calculates and returns the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements in the array.
# Problem 3
The "checkPrime" method checks whether a given integer is a prime number or not. If the input number is less than 2, the method outputs a message saying that the number needs to be more than 1. If the input number is 2, the method outputs a message saying that 2 is a prime number. For any other input number greater than 2, the method uses a for loop to check if the number is divisible by any integer between 2 and half of the number. If the number is found to be divisible by any of these integers, then it is marked as composite, otherwise, it is marked as prime. The method then outputs a message indicating whether the input number is prime or composite and returns a boolean value indicating whether the input number is prime or not.
# Problem 4
The "findFactorial" method recursively calculates the factorial of a given integer by multiplying the number with the factorial of the previous number until the base case of n=1 is reached. The method returns the product of all the numbers between the given integer and 1, which is the factorial of the given integer.
# Problem 5
The "findFibonacci" method recursively calculates the n-th number in the Fibonacci sequence by adding the previous two numbers in the sequence until the base case of n=0 or n=1 is reached. If n=0, the method returns 0, and if n=1, the method returns 1. For any other value of n, the method calls itself recursively with n-1 and n-2 and returns the sum of these two recursive calls.
# Problem 6
The "findPower" method calculates the value of a to the power of n using a loop that multiplies a by itself n times. The method initializes a variable "pow" to 1, and then multiplies it by the base value "a" for n number of times in a loop. The final value of "pow" is returned as the result of the power calculation.
# Problem 8
The "checkIsDigit" method checks whether a given string consists of only non-digit characters. The method iterates through each character in the input string using a for loop and checks if the character at each position is a digit using the "Character.isDigit" method. If a digit is found, the method immediately returns false, indicating that the string is not made up of only non-digit characters. If the loop completes without finding any digits, the method returns true, indicating that the string consists of only non-digit characters.
# Problem 9
The "findBinomCoeff" method recursively calculates the binomial coefficient of two given integers "a" and "n" using Pascal's triangle formula. The method checks for two base cases, where n=0 or n=a, in which the method returns 1. For any other values of "a" and "n", the method calls itself recursively with the new values of "a-1" and "n-1" and "a-1" and "n". The two results are then added together and returned as the binomial coefficient.
# Problem 10
The "findGCD" method recursively calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two given integers "a" and "n" using the Euclidean algorithm. The method checks for the base case where n=0, and in that case, returns a as the GCD. For any other values of "a" and "n", the method calls itself recursively with the new values of "n" and "a%n". The result of the recursive call is returned as the GCD of "a" and "n".
